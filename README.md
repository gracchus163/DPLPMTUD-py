# DPLPMTUD-py
Draft DPLPMTUD feasibility experiment
Implementation of Packetization Layer Path MTU Discovery for Datagram Transports [https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tsvwg-datagram-plpmtud-05]
for testing feasibility in the lab and some real world networks. It measures the Path MTU using the above algorithm with a variety of different search algorithms then stores the results.
Contains a client that runs the DPLPMTUD algorithm and an echo server that responds to probes and stores the experiment results.

Usage:
Nah don't do that
